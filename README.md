## CSDA Final Project (Reykjav√≠k University) - Malicious Web Server

The course "<b>C</b>omputer <b>S</b>ecurity defense against the <b>D</b>ark <b>A</b>rts" had a final project where I got to choose something to work on and present to the class. As the title suggests I decided to create a malicious web server that fakes the Google UI in order to steal your password.

### Tech Stack:

- HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Node.js
- MongoDB
